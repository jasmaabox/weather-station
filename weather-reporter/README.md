Raspberry Pi weather reporter.

## Getting Started

Adapted from: https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/get-wi-fi-internet-on-raspberry-pi-pico

Assemble electronics according to [diagram](docs/circuit.png).

Download and install [CircuitPython 7.x firmware for
Pico](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-circuitpython).

Download a 7.x release of [Adafruit CircuitPython
Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases) and
add following libraries to the Pico's `lib` directory:

- `adafruit_bus_device`
- `adafruit_esp32spi`
- `adafruit_requests.mpy`

Copy the following files from this folder into the Pico's top-level directory:

- `code.py`
- `utils.py`
- `secrets.sample.py`

In the Pico, rename `secrets.sample.py` to `secrets.py` and fill with appropriate
credentials. You will need an access token for the receiver from Cloudflare.
This can be generated by going to the [API tokens
page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens). On the page, create a
custom token and give it `Workers KV Storage:Edit` under Permissions.

Once code is installed on Pico, you can debug it through a serial connection in
PuTTY ([see
